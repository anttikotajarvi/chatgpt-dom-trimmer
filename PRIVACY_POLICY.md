_Last updated: 2025-08-10_

ChatGPT DOM Trimmer is a browser extension that runs entirely within your local browser.  
It is designed to optimize memory usage on the ChatGPT website by trimming and cleaning the Document Object Model (DOM) of old or hidden chat elements.

## Data Collection
- **No personal data is collected.**
- **No browsing history is recorded.**
- **No user input or chat content is stored or transmitted.**

All operations are performed locally in your browser session. The extension does not communicate with any remote servers other than the ChatGPT site you are already visiting.

## Permissions Justification
The following permissions are required for the extension to function:
- **`activeTab`** – Allows the extension to run trimming scripts on the currently active ChatGPT tab only when initiated by the user.
- **`scripting`** – Enables the extension to inject and execute DOM cleanup code in the ChatGPT page.
- **`storage`** – Used to save user preferences for trimming behavior locally in the browser.
- **`host permissions` (`https://chat.openai.com/*`)** – Grants access to modify the DOM structure of ChatGPT pages for cleanup.

## Third-Party Services
The extension does not use any third-party analytics, advertising networks, or tracking scripts.

## Local Storage
Settings such as the number of visible messages to keep are stored in your browser’s extension storage and never leave your device.
